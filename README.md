# Amazon-EDA
### 📖 Project Overview

This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Amazon Prime Video content catalog to uncover actionable insights for content strategy, regional planning, audience engagement, and platform growth.

Using IMDb metadata (ratings, votes, origin country, genre, certification, release year, runtime, content type), the analysis aims to transform raw data into meaningful recommendations that help Amazon Prime Video strengthen its competitive edge globally.

### 🎯 Business Objective

The primary objective of this project is to derive actionable insights from the Amazon Prime Video catalog to support data-driven decision-making for:

✔️ Content Acquisition & Production

Identify high-performing genres, certifications, and content types to guide future investments.

✔️ Regional Expansion

Understand country-level content distribution and identify regions needing localized or diversified content.

✔️ Temporal & Trend Analysis

Track how content availability, genre dominance, and audience preferences evolve over time.

✔️ Audience Satisfaction & Engagement

Leverage IMDb scores and popularity metrics to spotlight high-impact content and optimize viewer experience.

### 📊 Key Analyses Performed
1. Production Country Distribution

Bar plot reveals strong U.S. dominance but highlights a gap in international and localized content.

2. Certification (Age Rating) Performance

TV-PG and TV-MA consistently show the highest ratings, while family-oriented categories underperform due to quality gaps.

3. Ratings vs. Vote Count Clustering

A large cluster of highly rated but low-visibility titles indicates missed engagement opportunities.

4. Season Count vs. Content Trends

Historical peaks in TV show production (1990s–2000s) present lucrative licensing opportunities.

5. Runtime Stability Analysis

Average runtime has stayed remarkably stable (90–105 minutes) for decades, indicating format consistency but potential stagnation.

6. Yearly Rating Averages

Recent decades show rising average ratings, validating current production strategies.

7. Movie vs. TV Show Distribution

The catalog is heavily movie-dominant, signaling a gap in binge-worthy serialized content.

8. Genre & Audience Classification

Majority of content targets adults and teens; extremely limited children’s content restricts family market growth.

### 🚀 Strategic Recommendations
#### Positive Business Opportunities

* Invest heavily in TV-PG & TV-MA categories for high satisfaction and retention.

* Expand high-quality TV series, especially multi-season formats.

* Promote hidden high-rated content to improve engagement at low cost.

* Clean metadata to enhance discoverability and parental controls.

* Increase localized content in underrepresented regions.

* Acquire content from historical rating peaks (1970s, 1980s, early 2000s).

* Diversify formats with micro-series and long-form documentaries.

#### Risks / Negative Growth Factors

* Overreliance on mediocre but popular titles may harm brand perception.

* Weak family-friendly library risks losing a valuable demographic.

* Metadata gaps reduce usability and parental control reliability.

* Production cycle "troughs" can cause future content shortages if not mitigated.

### 🛠️ Technologies Used

* Python

* Pandas, NumPy

* Matplotlib, Seaborn

* Jupyter Notebook
### 🧠 Insights Summary

The analysis reveals that:

* Prime Video excels in adult and teen content but lacks strong offerings for children.

* High-quality content exists but remains under-promoted, limiting engagement.

* TV shows provide the highest retention value, yet the catalog is imbalanced toward movies.

* Regional diversity is low, creating an opportunity for international expansion.

* User ratings trends and historical production cycles offer powerful guidance for acquisitions and long-term planning.

### 🏁 Conclusion

This EDA converts Amazon Prime Video’s raw catalog data into powerful, strategic insights.
By acting on these findings, Amazon can:

* Improve content quality

* Boost global subscriber growth

* Strengthen customer satisfaction

* Reduce churn

* Enhance platform competitiveness
